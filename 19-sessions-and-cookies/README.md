# rails-dragons

This builds on our past practice project and involves adding sessions to our existing application

# *New Deliverables*
* A sign in page, where a user can start a session
* Automatically associate created dragons with the user who created them
* Prevent the user from creating a dragon with an empty name
* Provide error messages when an invalid form is submitted

# Instructions:
* Work in your existing local repository of the project
    * If you don't have a working version of dragons run `git checkout Part-III` then `git pull` to get a working copy of the application up to this point
* If you would like feedback on your implementation, commit and submit a pull request (Be sure to include "Part III" in the title of your pull request)
* Slack me if you get stuck anywhere for more than 30 minutes.
